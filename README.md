# 1. What Our Project Is
## 1.1 Motivation
Recently, OpenAI's Chat GPT has become a hot topic. Its influence is so powerful that it affects not only NLG area but also all areas.<br>
Our team hoped to use this ChatGPT to carry out special and interesting projects, and as a result, we decided to give ChatGPT a persona by characterizing it.<br>
Our goal is to make it seem like you are talking to a specific character in real life. Among the characters, we chose Harry Potter, which is familiar to many people.<br>
